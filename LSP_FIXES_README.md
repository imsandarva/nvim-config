# Neovim LSP and Autocompletion Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the two main issues you were experiencing:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Autocompletion Stops Working After 10 Minutes

**Problem**: Autocompletion would work for about 10 minutes after opening Neovim, then stop working. Pressing Enter would move the cursor to the next line instead of completing the suggestion.

**Root Cause**: LSP servers were timing out or becoming unresponsive, causing blink.cmp to lose connection.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `blink.cmp` configuration with LSP server management
- Added automatic LSP server restart on timeout (30 seconds)
- Added workspace refresh capabilities
- Implemented automatic health monitoring every 5 minutes

### 2. New Files Not Recognized by LSP

**Problem**: When creating new files through nvim-tree, LSP couldn't resolve imports or recognize the new files, showing "couldn't resolve this import" errors.

**Root Cause**: LSP servers weren't being notified about new files, and workspace wasn't being refreshed automatically.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced nvim-tree configuration with better LSP integration
- Added automatic workspace refresh when files are created/modified
- Implemented file system watching for better LSP integration
- Added manual workspace refresh keybindings

## New Keybindings

### LSP Management
- `<leader>lr` - Refresh LSP workspace
- `<leader>lR` - Restart all LSP servers
- `<leader>lc` - Force LSP reconnection

### Health Monitoring
- `<leader>hh` - Full health check
- `<leader>hl` - LSP health check only
- `<leader>hc` - Completion health check only

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced blink.cmp Configuration
```lua
lsp = {
  auto_restart = true,
  restart_on_timeout = true,
  timeout = 30000, -- 30 seconds
}
```

### 2. Enhanced nvim-tree Configuration
- Added `filesystem_watchers` for better file tracking
- Enhanced LSP integration settings
- Added automatic tree refresh on file changes

### 3. LSP Server Configuration
- Added workspace refresh capabilities
- Implemented automatic file change notifications
- Added better server management

### 4. Health Monitoring System
- Automatic health checks every 5 minutes
- Manual health check keybindings
- LSP server status monitoring

## How to Use

### Automatic Fixes
Most fixes are automatic and require no user intervention:
- LSP servers will automatically restart if they become unresponsive
- Workspace will automatically refresh when files are created/modified
- Health monitoring runs automatically in the background

### Manual Interventions
If you still experience issues:

1. **Check LSP Status**: Use `<leader>hl` to see if LSP servers are running
2. **Refresh Workspace**: Use `<leader>lr` to manually refresh the LSP workspace
3. **Restart LSP**: Use `<leader>lR` to restart all LSP servers
4. **Full Health Check**: Use `<leader>hh` for comprehensive diagnostics

### Testing the Fixes

1. **Autocompletion Test**:
   - Open a file and start typing
   - Autocompletion should work continuously without stopping
   - If it stops, use `<leader>lc` to reconnect

2. **New File Recognition Test**:
   - Create a new file using nvim-tree (`<C-b>` to open tree)
   - The file should be immediately recognized by LSP
   - No "couldn't resolve import" errors should appear

## Troubleshooting

### If Autocompletion Still Stops
1. Check LSP status: `<leader>hl`
2. Try reconnecting: `<leader>lc`
3. Check completion health: `<leader>hc`

### If New Files Still Not Recognized
1. Refresh workspace: `<leader>lr`
2. Restart LSP servers: `<leader>lR`
3. Check if nvim-tree is properly configured

### Performance Notes
- Health monitoring runs every 5 minutes (configurable)
- LSP server restarts are automatic but may cause brief delays
- File watching is enabled but optimized for performance

## Files Modified

1. `init.lua` - Main configuration with LSP enhancements
2. `lua/custom/plugins/nvim-tree.lua` - Enhanced nvim-tree configuration
3. `lua/custom/mappings.lua` - Added LSP management keybindings
4. `lua/custom/health.lua` - Health monitoring system (new file)

## Restart Required

After applying these changes, you'll need to restart Neovim for all fixes to take effect. The health monitoring will start automatically on the next startup.

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after implementing these fixes:
1. Run `<leader>hh` for a full health check
2. Check the Neovim messages for any error notifications
3. Verify that all required plugins are properly installed
